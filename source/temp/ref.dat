God, youre beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do. I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and hes not into anything weird sexually.
What?
Hey dude, whats up?
Hey...
You were supposed to duck!!! Why didnt you duck?
Yeah.
Well, I was due.
Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Yeah, you too.
Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Yknow, when we talked about face to face, I dont think we thought it all the way through. Hey Pheebs!
What?
Yeah uh look Rach, theres something I gotta tell ya.
Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? Im not good enough for you?
Okay.
Oh my God!
Dude, Im sorry. But hey, theres one spot left, right?
Ahhh!
Hit me, hit me.
So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm…
Will the stable boy never get the princess??
Can I offer you a drink?
No, look, you know Charlie, right? Shes cool, shes funny, her body is soo...
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Thats your move? Boy Rach, youre lucky youre hot.
oh why dont you fly out there and surprise him.
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I dont know, I guess Ill just take it back.
Seriously, thats your fantasy? To invest it?
Whaaat?
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youve been Bamboozled!
Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Lets hear their plan! Now, whats the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
Oh, I thought I heard a mans voice before.
Yeah, I thought you knew that.
I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
Hey!
And Ill have all the muffins.
Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.  Whats the matter?
No! No. Umm, just myself and if they dont like me for— Im sorry I couldnt even get through that.
Oh my God. You do?
Look, Ill get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the question.
Chandler... hey...  Rach... whats Hugsy doin in the crib with Emma?
The Metsss!
What? Im not allowed to know smart women?
Night.
Well whats complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! Youre in Paradise Pond!
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Rosss points!
What was the other one Ross?
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Oh.. man..
She took ‘em!
Im falling in love with you.
What? Are you referring to my mans bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but its practical too. Check it out! Its got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Oh sure, yeah, why not?
Why not?
Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentines Day.
There you go sweetie...  This isnt over.
Come here!
Yes.
I have to go to the bathroom too, but I dont want him complimenting my thing.
That... never happens...
Excellent! Lets play Bamboozled! Chandler, youll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
Where?
Hey Ross! The babys kicking!
Rachel... lets be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
What are you doing? I said seven!   Argh!!!
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!"
Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
Its like my favorite fairy tale come true!  The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!
Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?  Have you not talked about it yet?  Am I making you uncomfortable?  If you were bigger youd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh
"I am what you made me! You know what?"
and whos fault is that.
Thats okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now were friends again everythings great! Please, were trying to have a conversation.
No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone youre not…
When have I ever done that?!
Yeah, like a moth to a flame, Im telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
Ok, all right, so Ill take her to the MET.
Oh hey, dont worry about it man. Dont worry about it, no big deal.
Oh, yknow what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. Im a not, Im not wearing any bottoms.
Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
What the hell am I supposed to do!
Hey I got one! I got one!
Well, neither.
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
Oh!
I guess not.
Oh, its a poster for that World War I movie that Im in, check it out.
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
I cant believe you guys are moving.
So, I dont have to learn what that means?
Sure.
Yowsa!
Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
Oh, I dont know.
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.
Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there�s still some food left on their place, okay, what�s the restaurant�s policy about people eatin� that?
What?!
Yes!
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
So...Ive never played that!
Name?  I know Ross but whats it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
Its a one-woman play called "Why dont you like me: a bitter womans journey through life".
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think Im…falling in love with you.
I love you.
What, what.
Mia Hamm?
Great! Go get him.
Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
No, he really said it.
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
Then why did I ask?
Hit me.
Ok.
Thursday? But that�s Halloween.
Hey thanks.
Hey. So wheres Mon?
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Bye. Theres one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
I need to talk to you about Charlie.
Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she wont go easy.
Yeah! Look!
Its nothing.
Oh hey Rach!
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-stars good but theyre not as good as me!
What?!
Oh. Whats, whats going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dads heart? Is that a sandwich?
Hey!
Hey, how you doin? Hey! How you doin?
Little bit.
I cant believe you guys went for that one!
She is?
Come on! you...
Hey so wheres Ross?
Why not?
Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, youre the single one, seen anybody in there you like?
Little bit, yeah.
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
Its Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
Hey!
I cant believe I won.
Your thumb? Thats weird.  You sure youre punching right? Make a fist.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didnt…I didnt propose!
But over the past few weeks…
Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
You were right. He is funny.
Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go  ohhhh!
Without that, you just got "lame with women".
Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
Hey!
And I couldnt find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
Because I forgot about our date, Im so sorry.
Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.
Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! Were waiting!   Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all.  Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
But.
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.
"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
No, look, I dont know what else to do. I said Im sorry!
Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
You dont wanna see what I just saw!
Oh, I just…I feel terrible.
Im gonna go shave.
Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, Ill bring you a hat, cover up the bald? Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you dont hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?
Why not?  Youll feel better!  Ill feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
Yeah.
Okay, how did this even happen?
What he wants to buy your baby?!
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Yknow now its like…things are different.
A widower.
What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.
Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Thank you!
Hey!
Which part exactly?
Ew.
Ooh! Ah! Okay!
Youre leaving too? Good night!
Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on your…
All right now, so? What do you think?
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "youre gonna get eaten by a bear".
You got it. Come here.
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
From school.
Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Seriously, who is this guy?
Hey. Im here for my eyebrow appointment. Chandler Bing. OK Thanks.
What?
All right. Its a new day, and its just a crush, thats all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everythings going to be fine. Its just a crush.
Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy!  He brought Twizlers!
Ill be fun.
All right.
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Yeah! I totally forgot Im supposed to be there. I cant believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldnt.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
Thanks man. Where are you going?
Hey, whats up?
NO BIG DEAL!
aaand SEND!
Rachel stuff.
What-what?
Nothing major, its just that, you know, theyre not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.
Nice to meet ya!   Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it  Thanks for coming.
Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and Ill get you good and drunk!
Youre Rachel!
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
Hey! Dont worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Rosss speech...
Thats right I am!
Actually, I really need…
Hey! How come my plates less fancy then everyone elses? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
Oh hey whoa-whoa, dont worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
You do it!
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
Okay. And uh, are you married.
Hey!
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.
I did?
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
No, no, its not a girl, its... a brand new Hugsy!
And you couldnt think of anything else?!
Yeah.
Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you! Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends. Really? Me? Wow! I dont even know any huge gay people!
Who the hell is this guy?
Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
So you uh, have a…big work problem?
Whats going on?
Oh my God!
Oh really? Thatd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
But hes the same.
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants! Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
No, they�re comin�, we�re waitin� right here.
Sure. "Monica."
And youre not helping?
Yeah, right Monica.� Im so sorry.
All right. Its a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you dont feel that now. It was crazy! Youre fine. Youre better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everythings normal! Shes just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.
Hey.
No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!
Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
What do you mean?
It wasnt my ring! It fell out of Rosss jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
It cant be me, Im standing right here.
But what if uh—and Im not saying she will be—But…
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I dont know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
That�s a great story�can I eat it?
Dont interrupt me when Im talkin to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…
Oh...I dont think its going very well...
I dont know. Its-its just…lately, Ive been feeling… Okay, heres what it is…  You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!
Oh, thats cool. We have interns at Days Of Our Lives.
Oh, ehm...Im...Im rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. Its the first time my characters got one. Im so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
Hey-hey-hey, hey! You cant. Okay? Ever!
What is it? Hey!
It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
I didnt have to tell you that!! Im stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Yes! Yes, youre back in the lead!
Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
Why dont I take you out?
Oh hey but, before you guys do that  I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
Please, cmon, youre the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I dont wanna lose her.
Hey! You made it!
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Well, just wake him up!
I cant look at you right now!
Hey Monica!  People came to see a fight, lets give ‘em what they came for!
Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
Me too. I mean I…havent thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didnt feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
No, I-I-I wasnt making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.
Well, he said I wasnt urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.
Im mad at you for leaving! Youre nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Whoa, whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
Yeah, just a crush! Thats all this is! Its a crush! Im Joey; I dont get deep feelings.
Arghhh! Double standards!
Yeah! Ill see ya later! Yeah!
Okay.
Look forget it forget it... I cant do it.
Sure.
Hello, Im Joey Tribbiani! Lets play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
Uh… How long have we known each other?
Atta boy! Okay, look...
Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, were almost there! Were almost there!
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
Im sorry, youre right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!
Oh.. I dont know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
No, I didnt!
Hey, that is so great about the job.
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I
I know, but I dont think thats what she wants.
Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isnt fair. What makes you think that Im just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Cant you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I havent felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didnt think I could ever love again. Ok
Are you kidding me?!
Can you believe theyre still not here?
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
Lets just say I took care of it.
I know. I know.
Yes. Its just that shes so much smarter than all the girls Ive ever dated! Combined! I dont want her to think Im stupid!
You sure?!
I was?
Look Phoebe Im so sorry! Hey, look, if you dont like this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!
Dont start doing that. You cant do that Rach, ‘cause then youre gonna make me do that.  Oh, here we go!
I like those odds!
I know were not, but  Frank Medeio and...  Eva Trorro... womba...
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no!  I couldnt do it to Ross!
Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; shes still in the bedroom.
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didnt want to say anything cause I didnt want to jinx it.
No!
Heeeyy! Hey!
This one right here.
This conversation never happened!
Thats right! By his uncle too!
All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.
Yeah, yeah. Ive got tons of stuff I could do. Im gonna hit the beach, go swimming...
Because she is!
Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
You know what you shouldve done, you should have told yourself that little story.
I can an A? In-in school?  Hey, Im a dork.
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
Thats right, youre not. Youre a nurse. Youre Nurse With Tray.
No.
Allright. See you later!
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later.
Its okay, its okay Rach, its me. Put down the scrunchy.
No thats all right. Dont worry about it.
Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I didnt even do anything wrong.
Thank you so much.
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. Youre not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean.
Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesnt matter, because I cant do anything about it.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Hes not really my type.
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
Uh...well...just once...with you...
Yeah.
Ah! Im an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Catwoman, hands down.
This is so exciting for her. Well, Ill let you two fash…ists get down to business.
Ok!
I dont know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.  Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin?"
Now lets not get carried away.
Im fine, Im fine, its just, its just weird whats happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. Thats all.
Hey dont worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.
Did that guy really make that joke?
Great! Thanks! Youre gonna love her so much. And—Oh, shes the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, yknow the S.A.Ts?
Man, this is bad! And Ive had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though.  "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Its really gone?
Okay, uh…sit down.  Um… theres this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it cant happen.
All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
My God.
No! No, fear of the number 13.
Hey.
Mmh-mmh.
Oh, I dont know.
Well whats fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game thats just people standing around answering questions?
Weve been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.
In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We dont need no stinkin badges!"
Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
Double promise? Call me when you land.
You dont have to seem so happy about it.
Yeah.
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didnt have to change.
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
What?!
Ok... I mean...
Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Shes probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
It wasnt my ring! Its Rosss ring! Thats why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
Hey.  Ross, I know youre pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
I know, yeah. I feel like were all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.
I dont know.
You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
You damn right I am, Ive been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! Its about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise thats not gonna happen.
I think Ive been recognized, this happens all the time!
Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. Cause hes feeling like...
Come on, Ross, that didnt mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
Dont worry! Dont worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You dont go buying peoples babies, so back off!!"
Fine ... mediocre porn
No, come on Ross!  Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
You dont have to worry about that okay?
If you want I could loan you some money?
I thought you already have a job.
I.. I.. I need a good lie.
Wheres Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day.  ... and I smelled bacon.
Hi! Im Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
I do it every year.
Theyre ribbed for *your* pleasure.
Bite me?
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
Oh, I dont watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, yknow? Oh, good to know.  So close!
Its Monica, ok?
She looks so real!  Yknow what I mean! Shes this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.
Hes breathing!
Oh! Hows it going?
Definitely not invisible.
Oh.  Yeah.  Me to.
Yeah.
Finally you guys made it.  Pheebs, who the hell�uhuhh!
Yeah!
If you ask me to stay, I�ll pee.
Oh yeah.
Boob job.
Well, it must be, because I read and I didnt understand a singe word.
Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?  There you go.
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
No, why? Oh man!
Why?
No, no. Nurse With Tray doesnt know Joey, she doesnt have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesnt, people die!
Oh, whats wrong?
Oh, cmon, I mean, theres you, then theres Charlie, and its like...  What the hell is my problem? OH!
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
Look at this. My two best friends!
Nothing…
Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? Theres a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivias bedroom, and she doesnt know hes there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldnt be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.  Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!!
Dont you lie to me! I could tell by Chandlers hair.  You are so lazy. Cant you get on top for once?
Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
Is that a sandwich?!
Judge rules, no violation.
Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And Im not just saying this because Im your friend, Im sayin it ‘cause its the truth. Youre food is abysmal!
So youre ruling out surrogacy?
Please dont fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Theres this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, its complicated.  Shes with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, yknow?  Ccause were really good friends.
Hey, I tell you what. Lets you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
No.
gesundheit
Hey,  how you doin?
Uh, ah, Monicas pregnant?!
Fifth days a charm.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!
I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Really?!
Oh my god Ross! You dont have Emma! And Rachel you dont have Emma!  Wheres Emma? Who has Emma!?

I know, I know! But Ive thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldnt be right...  Im sorry...!
Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You dont have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  Okay, you gotta say something!
Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but youre so beautiful…I dont think I can.
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh—Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface.
What the hell are you talking about??
What are you guys doing in here?
Thats a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so were good.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!

Gotcha.
Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
Bub!!!   I cant believe this! Youre the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
"I cant. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I cant."
Rach, I gotta say...if you werent here wondering if these guys were gay I dont know if I could do this!
Yeah, I guess it is. And so… Im gonna get on this spaceship,  and Im gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, youll be long gone. But I wont have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…Im gonna want to meet her. Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See Im comin to fix the copier, I cant get to the copier, Im thinkin what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch em have sex. And then I say, wait, heres my line,  you know thats bad for the paper tray.
Mike, attorney at law!
I cant tell you what Im wishing for! Else...you know...wont come true!
Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
Im not quite sure.
Yeah, thats because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
Ooh.  So umm, I was talkin to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
Uh-huh.
Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to come over>
I do not.
Son of a bitch!
A place to eat spaghetti.
I wasnt gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!
So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. Hows it going?
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Yeah me too, all night.
Alright, have a good time.
Are you sure?
Yeah!
Hey!  As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
Ooh. I-I dont know Chan. Im not so good with remembering lines.
well thats not even the weird part. I dont think she remembered sleeping with me.
I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, its Rachel for God sakes.
Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Yes!
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
We gotta get more of that.
Ah, Rach, it doesnt say that!
Mines is to Lilian Myers.
Now you cant tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.
Okay. Okay, so Im writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?
No.
I dont know, but it sounds great.
Thats not fair! I cant do that.
Well what do I know?! Im not a doctor!

All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why dont you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Okay. Im Chandler
Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
Oh hey!
Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause youre my baby sister!
But Rachel has an apartment.
Oh no, I cant go. Im practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
Rightie-O Ray!
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.  Oh, me, right!
And youre Okay with that?
Either eat it, or be in it.
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emmas chubby little hands wrapped around ya.  Its okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
Oh my God I have to tell her! I havent even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
I miss this.
I couldnt help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
Then dont go!
So you uh, nervous about getting married?
Dude, you see right thru me!!
Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel.
I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
I should know that. Lets see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Hey!� Open the door.� Whats going on?�  What are you . ..� � Why are you dressed like that?
I guess I didnt really think about it.
Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot?
That noise can only me one thing.
Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get…
Thats it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?
Hey you guys Im gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a "Galaxy far, far away"? .
Oh my God!
Age?
Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parkers a nice guy and Id like to get to know him.
Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... its a stuffed animal... you know... its for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Yeah. Id seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Hey!
Come on! Youre good with kids. Theyre just crazy on Halloween. Yknow, theyre all greedy and hopped up on sugar!
Chandler?
Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if youre gonna have a roommate, yknow it might as well be the father.
But hes the same.
I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and youre all invited!
For a walk.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Right!
Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Forget about it. Its no big deal.
Yeah hes lying. He looked down.
Also so gay!
What?! Why?!
Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it�s ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don�t care.
No, no, no, no! Hes fine! Look, look, look!  Heres your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball!  Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, its really bumpy! .
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
No, sorry havent seen him.
COME . . .� HOME.
Yeah! Right!  People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: "Excuse me, Ill have a bucket of fried bird."  Or... or maybe just a wing or...
Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.
Yeah, it is. Its really tough. Yknow sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!
I am on fire! Err... Kind of.
Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
Look, its not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I dont want to hurt her.
How long do you have to go for?
Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas…and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime theyre hungry or sleepy. Yknow, kids are tough. Good luck with that.
Hey!� How come the doors locked?
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
You dont own a TV? Whats all your furniture pointed at??
Molly ... people dont study acting ...
listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
I did?
Oh, Id love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first

I know, but Im a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
Thanks so much, Pheebs!  We are going to have so much fun, yes we are!  Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Dear Lord.
What? Thats the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Yeah! How you doin? Yeah alright! Hey, hey! You said youre gonna wear a thong, wheres the thong?
Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they dont sell tickets here in New York, so...
Oh my, oh my God!
Interesting. all right Ill go out with her again and try to get past it  OH SALT BLOATY!
Thats right! ‘Cause Im a Tribbiani!  And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we dont read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!
I know! Do you wanna do it?
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin?
Yeah, hes done some amazing works.
Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, Im just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
Yeah, thats one naked hooker!
What the hell are you talking about,  "The south will rise again man."
Phoebe!
Barbados!
Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isnt as glamorous and exciting as you think.
Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guys not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
Something personal.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
It is so amazing to meet you.  Im such a big fan of your work.
I really doubt that.
Yeah.
Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats…
Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
Oh!
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but its like enough!
Actually its not pies, its just pie.
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
I just want you to say it once in a while.
All right lets just do this.
You lied to me!
Whats going on?
Sure, yeah. I dont have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
Maybe you two should live together.
Youre a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
By you!?
Monica!
Oh, women can. You cant.
Yeah...
Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Yeah-yeah right. Thats okay. Thats fine. Thats uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, its no big deal. All right? I think Im gonna go.
How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
Hey, its great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
Wooooooooow  Its like theyre on fire!
I know. All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
Yeah.
Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everythings gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go.  Oww crushing bones! Hey! So?
No, its not, we have nothing in common!
No, I said fun!
Hi. When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack? Cheese makes me thirsty. All right.
Hi.
Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
Well, its complicated. Shes with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because were really good friends.
Oh what then? Kick me?
So you see, Molly, what people dont understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.
Oh thats terrible. Im-Im really sorry.
You hung up on the pizza place? I dont hang up on your friends.
This is embarrassing.
Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
Im up all night!
� Why do I smell mens cologne?
Hey!
Okay, so will you meet with her?
You are my Everest.
My little sister Dina!
Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Erectus?
What the hell!
What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
What? You think Im too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think Im like, "Duh."�
Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
Ah! Okay, well then you dont judge me. Im gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that Im in love with Olivia.
Hey, it hasnt come to that yet.  Hey hey hey! Dont mind if I do!
Me neither.
But Im bursting with u-hu!
Okay, its an audio question, name this television theme song.
You like me?
Hello?
No, Rach, I shouldve told you sooner. Its just that…Man! That kid is going to town!
I dunno!
Hes the same!  Youre not the same!
Ooh, thats a great plan!
Couldnt have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
Hey, so, uh, hows it going living over at Ross?
Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?
Dude!
Hey.
"You know!"
Date of birth?
Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so Im drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious.
Hey, I gotta! Unless...
Morning, roomie!
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre not gonna be on TV!
Im an actor, yknow? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Dude I just did something terrible.
Are you kiddin? When they shoot you out of that cannon…
Hey uh Monica, I cant remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Correct! Theres a possible backwards bonus!
All right Chandler, youre up.
Aaaah…
Oh, relax. Dont be. Youll be fine, youll be fine. Theyll probably just make you stand in the back.
Uh… Look Rach… Hey Ross is here! Hey look! Its my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Hey! You dont get a say in this!
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
Id love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. Shes sleeping.  Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Well what am I supposed to do?
Hey! Its my fashion girls!  Whats wrong?
She hot?
Oh hey, you should be excited about him. Theres nothing wrong with him hes a good guy.
Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. Thatd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when Im a little bloated I dont feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN IM BETTER THEN MOST!
I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
Im so bored! Stupid rain, we... we cant do anything.
Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
Me.
Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Face to face, yeah!
Its a grand tradition!
Mike.
Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball!  Well, youre cute, but youre not too smart!  Did I just throw this?
that wouldve been better, Ill try that Hi Im Joey.
No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasnt at a work thing today.
Shes this really boring woman. Shes a teacher!
No, hey, its been great.
Oh, I love you too.
Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Oh my God. So thats it?! I only get to bring one guest?
I guess Im going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasnt there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
Ross!
Yeah, and so funny!
Ohh!
Do, do you gonna do it now?
Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike. No, no, thats not what I meant. Lets get you a cocktail.
Dude, step up! I proposed.
do you have any cake?  AWCH! Thats why.
...No...
Yeah, he had a paper route.
Hey! Im an  actor too! Im not sure. I think theyre taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so
Its Rachel.
No-no, I cant! I cant! Not after the other night, its just its…too weird, okay? Dont tell her Im here!  Dont eat that!
Hey!
Oh hey-hey!
Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Come on, Ill show you guys where to check in
I guess it couldve been, I didnt really look at it. Yknow, I just wiped it on Chandlers coat and got the hell out of there.
Oh thats right. Theres a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? Whats up?
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, thats the first A Ive gotten since seventh grade, and I didnt have to sleep with the teacher this time.
But you two were supposed to be together.
Yeah?�
Maybe we should just eat now.
Youre not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I cant believe youre taking this away from me!
Sort of.
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesnt matter.
come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was  a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had sex  here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
Oh, yah, sure.
Ah, y-y-youre sure you dont want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern  "I could go right now, maaan!"
But between you and Phoebe, Id have to give the edge to Phoebe.
Hey!
No they cant! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
What?
Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean youre not working and the economy is bad.
Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day Ill  Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night Ill be  Joey Trrrribbiani!
What party?
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.  Im an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!
Which were still keeping under our hats!
Im a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Ok, Ross! Its... Its fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Look at this clown! Just because hes got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.  Get out of the way jackass!  Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?
Its no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. Its just a crush! Its going to go away!  Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
Oh yeah? All right, lets do it tonight.
Oh uh, it didnt work out.
A little bit more.
Whats the matter, Pheebs?
I know! I found it on the street.
Not really.
All right, lets do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.
Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
Uh! Thats a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and...  no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?
Dont worry, Tribbianis never get full.
Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Oh, yeah.
Whyre you so tired?
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
A MONTH??
Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
Thanks. But maybe later.
A little tall.
Yes… ahahaaa
Well, actually it...
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I dont…
Uhuh.
Oh, wish me luck!
Well, before, with the wishbone... I didnt wish we would win the lottery, I wished youd get the job.
Oh, no dont worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
Hey. Well, whats up?
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
She even reads for pleasure!
Congratulations! You just got married!

Really?
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isnt Rachel.
Okay thats the green stuff talkin.
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I cant have it makes me want her even more!
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross dont…
Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes itll be hard, okay? But, itll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so Im gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, so he said: "If your puppy friend doesnt get her puppy act together, Im gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."
Ill do it!! Itll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Why wouldnt she? Hes a wonderful person!
Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brothers triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
Oh ...  Happy birth ...  oh, see you later
Hey, its your girlfriend, Rachel!
Huh. Huh.
"Whered you grow up," its so simple!
Not knowing when to shut up...
Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, Id just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also:  How you doing?  You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.
Really...? Guys do that...? Thats... weird...
Are you kidding me? Im great! Yeah, Im uh; Im better than great. I am good. And now that shes gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldnt do before. Yknow? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Yknow? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Yknow? I like being on my own, Im uh, better off this way. Im uh, a lone wolf. Yknow? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. Whats a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
You almost had me.
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
I dont know! Maybe shes crazy!
Were not peeking?
Well, Im feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
I dont want to. You do it!
Well its...Its not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually?
I know
Aww, I dont know Monica yknow... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
