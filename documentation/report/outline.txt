Abstract
Introduction:
- Introduce the problem and our solutions
- Mention that we have two different models that we used
- Hint at conclusion
Evaluation Metrics:
- Why is this a problem
- What we tried
- - Automatic metrics with brief description of each
- - Human metric idea, execution and examples
Seq2Seq Model:
- Why we tried this
- What this model has
- Issues/Problems in implementation
- Review of results
- - Automatic Metric results
- - Human Metric results
- Error analysis
- - What examples did it fail on and why do we think?
- - Can we suggest future edits to correct this?
- Conclusion
- - Did the model work
