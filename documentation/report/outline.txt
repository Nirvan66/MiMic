Abstract
Introduction:
- Introduce the problem and our solutions
- Why is this good for nn?
- Mention that we have two different models that we used
- Hint at conclusion
Dataset:
- Describe our datasets and why we used them
- Data error analysis
Evaluation Metrics:
- Why is this a problem
- What we tried
- - Automatic metrics with brief description of each
- - Human metric idea, execution and examples
Seq2Seq Model:
- Why we tried this
- What this model has
- Issues/Problems in implementation (fail)
- Review of results
- - Automatic Metric results
- - Human Metric results
- Error analysis
- - What examples did it fail on and why do we think?
- - Can we suggest future edits to correct this?
- Conclusion
- - Did the model work
Transformer Model:
- Why we tried this
- What this model has
- Issues/Problems in implementation
- Review of results
- - Automatic Metric results
- - Human Metric results
- Error analysis
- - What examples did it fail on and why do we think?
- - Can we suggest future edits to correct this?
- Conclusion
- - Did the model work
Problem Conclusion:
- Did it work well?
- What else we would like to have tried?
- More data! More complexity!
