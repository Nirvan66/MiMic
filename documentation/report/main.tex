	\begin{abstract}
		In this project we explored the problem of creating a chatbot that could mimic a popular television character's personality, Joey from Friends.
		Our dataset was extracted directly from the Friends' scripts of each season. 
		We worked with two different neural network models which we trained on the same dataset: a sequence-to-sequence model and a transformer model. 
		To evaluate our models' performance we considered automatic metrics often used to evaluate translation bots and a human based metric inspired by the Turing test.
		Not surprisingly, neither model performed well with respect to the automatic metrics considered.
		Moreover, we found that both models failed to consistently convince a human tester that their responses captured the personality of Joey.
		We review a collection of troublesome instances for each model and theorize ways in which each model could be improved.
		We conclude that both models had only minor success but it may be interesting to experiment with slightly more complex models on different datasets.

	\section{Introduction}
	A chatbot is a program that provides conversational output in response to user input.
	They have many applications such as customer support interfaces, general question answering services, translation apps and virtual assistants.
	A common goal for chatbots is to simulate a human like interaction for the user.
	To this end many researches have investigated creating chatbots with "personality" or "identity" \cite{Li2016, LINH2019, QianHZXZ17, ZhouHZZL17,NMC2017}.
	Inspired by these works, in this project we attempt to train two different neural network models to act as a chatbot which simulates a known tv character personality, Joey from Friends.
	
	Chatbots with personality would have many real life applications.
	They could be used to give much more personalized and thoughtful user experiences in almost any natural chatbot application.
	A key example would be having options for a personal assistants such as Alexa or Siri 
	Moreover, chatbots that mimic popular personalities such as those in popular television shows could have a lot of commercial success as entertaining 
	For example, talking online with a witty or caring chatbot may 

	\subsection{Style}
	
	Papers to be submitted to NeurIPS 2019 must be prepared according to the
	instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages long,
	including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and/or
		cited references} are allowed. Papers that exceed eight pages of content
	(ignoring references) will not be reviewed, or in any other way considered for
	presentation at the conference.
	
	The margins in 2019 are the same as since 2007, which allow for $\sim$$15\%$
	more words in the paper compared to earlier years.
	
	Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
	NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
	and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
	rejection.
	
	\subsection{Retrieval of style files}
	
	The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on
	the World Wide Web at
	\begin{center}
		\url{http://www.neurips.cc/}
	\end{center}
	The file \verb+neurips_2019.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
	various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.
	
	The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2019 is \verb+neurips_2019.sty+,
	rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{} 2.09,
		Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}
	
	The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
	creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
	submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
	\verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.
	
	\paragraph{Preprint option}
	If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
	NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a
	nonanonymized version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
	in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do
		not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
	papers accepted to NeurIPS.
	
	At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
	options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
	review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
	will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.
	
	The file \verb+neurips_2019.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
	paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
	the paper with your own.
	
	The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
	Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.
	
	\section{General formatting instructions}
	\label{gen_inst}
	
	The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
	9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
	type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
	preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
	Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
	indentation.
	
	The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
	between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
	bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
	below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
	top of the page.
	
	For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
	centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
	first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
	follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
	side.
	
	Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
	regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.
	
	\section{Headings: first level}
	\label{headings}
	
	All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
	flush left, and bold.
	
	First-level headings should be in 12-point type.
	
	\subsection{Headings: second level}
	
	Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.
	
	\subsubsection{Headings: third level}
	
	Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.
	
	\paragraph{Paragraphs}
	
	There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
	bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
	of space.
	
	\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
	\label{others}
	
	These instructions apply to everyone.
	
	\subsection{Citations within the text}
	
	The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
	author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
	format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
	used consistently.
	
	The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
	\begin{center}
		\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
	\end{center}
	Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
	use in inline text.  For example,
	\begin{verbatim}
	\citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
	\end{verbatim}
	produces
	\begin{quote}
		Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
	\end{quote}
	
	If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
	following before loading the \verb+neurips_2019+ package:
	\begin{verbatim}
	\PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
	argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
	\begin{verbatim}
	\usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2019}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
	person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
	previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
	(e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
	citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''
	
	\subsection{Footnotes}
	
	Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
	footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
	text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
	Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).
	
	Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
	marks.\footnote{As in this example.}
	
	\subsection{Figures}
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
		\caption{Sample figure caption.}
	\end{figure}
	
	All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
	purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
	figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
	the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
	proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.
	
	You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
	paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
	color.
	
	\subsection{Tables}
	
	All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
	title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.
	
	Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
	table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
	be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
	numbered consecutively.
	
	Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
	strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
	typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
	\begin{center}
		\url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
	\end{center}
	This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.
	
	\begin{table}
		\caption{Sample table title}
		\label{sample-table}
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{lll}
			\toprule
			\multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
			\cmidrule(r){1-2}
			Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
			\midrule
			Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
			Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
			Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\section{Final instructions}
	
	Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
	particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
	fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
	\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
	numbered.
	
	\section{Preparing PDF files}
	
	Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
	example, ``A4.''
	
	Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
	contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
	achieve this.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.
		
		\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
		menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
		also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
		available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.
		
		\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
		acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
		\url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}
		
		\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
		"solid" shapes instead.
		
		\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
		the equivalent AMS Fonts:
		\begin{verbatim}
		\usepackage{amsfonts}
		\end{verbatim}
		followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
		for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
		workaround for reals, natural and complex:
		\begin{verbatim}
		\newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
		\newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
		\newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
		\end{verbatim}
		Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
	you to fix it.
	
	\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}
	
	Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
	\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
	\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
	figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
	\begin{verbatim}
	\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
	\end{verbatim}
	See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
	(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})
	
	A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
	line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
	necessary.
	
	\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}
	
	Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
	go at the end of the paper. Do not include acknowledgments in the anonymized
	submission, only in the final paper.
